        <p>Hello, my name is Mark. This is my page. A little bit about me I suppose. 
            I did Stand Up comedy in the Minneapolis area for about 6 months, and was once told by a better known comedian that I reminded him of Louis C.K. 
            One week later Louis C.K. had announced that he had been jerking off in front of women, and I could only think "How did he know that too?"
        </p>
        <p>Otherwise, I also do 3D modeling utilizing Blender, and occassionaly do work with Habitat for Humanity. 
         I don't get a sense of joy out of building the houses for lesser off families. 
         I just get joy out of building a house, regardless of who lives in it. 
         Ted Bundy could live in it, and I wouldn't care, nor remember that I helped build it.
        </p>
